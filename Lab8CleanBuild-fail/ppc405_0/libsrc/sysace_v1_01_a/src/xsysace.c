* The Xilinx System ACE driver component. This driver supports the Xilinx
* System Advanced Configuration Environment (ACE) controller. It currently
* supports only the CompactFlash solution. See xsysace.h for a detailed
* description of the driver.

* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00a rpm  06/17/02 work in progress
* 1.00a rmm  05/14/03 Fixed diab compiler warnings relating to asserts
* 1.01a jvb  12/13/05 I changed Initialize() into CfgInitialize(), and made
*                     CfgInitialize() take a pointer to a config structure
*                     instead of a device id. I moved Initialize() into
*                     xgpio_sinit.c, and had Initialize() call CfgInitialize()
*                     after it retrieved the config structure using the device
*                     id. I removed include of xparameters.h along with any
*                     dependencies on xparameters.h and the _g.c config table.
*                     The dependency on XPAR_XSYSACE_MEM_WIDTH still remains.

* Attempt to lock access to the CompactFlash. The CompactFlash may be accessed

*
* If the user requests a forced lock, the JTAG configuration controller will
* be put into a reset state in case it currently has a lock on the CompactFlash.
* This effectively aborts any operation the configuration controller had in
