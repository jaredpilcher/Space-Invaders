*
* The Xilinx System ACE driver. This driver supports the Xilinx System Advanced
* Configuration Environment (ACE) controller. It currently supports only the
* CompactFlash solution. The driver makes use of the Microprocessor (MPU)
* interface to communicate with the device.
*
* The driver provides a user the ability to access the CompactFlash through
* the System ACE device.  The user can read and write CompactFlash sectors,
* identify the flash device, and reset the flash device.  Also, the driver
* provides a user the ability to configure FPGA devices by selecting a
* configuration file (.ace file) resident on the CompactFlash, or directly
* configuring the FPGA devices via the MPU port and the configuration JTAG
* port of the controller.
*
* <b>Initialization & Configuration</b>
*
* The XSysAce_Config structure is used by the driver to configure itself. This
* configuration structure is typically created by the tool-chain based on HW
* build properties.
*
* To support multiple runtime loading and initialization strategies employed
* by various operating systems, the driver instance can be initialized in one
* of the following ways:
*
*   - XSysAce_Initialize(InstancePtr, DeviceId) - The driver looks up its own
*     configuration structure created by the tool-chain based on an ID provided
*     by the tool-chain.
*
*   - XSysAce_CfgInitialize(InstancePtr, CfgPtr, EffectiveAddr) - Uses a
*     configuration structure provided by the caller. If running in a system
*     with address translation, the provided virtual memory base address
*     replaces the physical address present in the configuration structure.
*
* <b>Bus Mode</b>
*
* The System ACE device supports both 8-bit and 16-bit access to its registers.
* The driver defaults to 8-bit access, but can be changed to use 16-bit access
* at compile-time.  The compile-time constant XPAR_XSYSACE_MEM_WIDTH must be
* defined equal to 16 to make the driver use 16-bit access. This constant is
* typically defined in xparameters.h.
*
* <b>Endianness</b>
*
* The System ACE device is little-endian. If being accessed by a big-endian
* processor, the endian conversion will be done by the device driver. The
* endian conversion is encapsulated inside the XSysAce_RegRead/Write functions
* so that it can be removed if the endian conversion is moved to hardware.
*
* <b>Hardware Access</b>
*
* The device driver expects the System ACE controller to be a memory-mapped
* device. Access to the System ACE controller is typically achieved through
* the External Memory Controller (EMC) IP core. The EMC is simply a pass-through
* device that allows access to the off-chip System ACE device. There is no
* software-based setup or configuration necessary for the EMC.
*
* The System ACE registers are expected to be byte-addressable. If for some
* reason this is not possible, the register offsets defined in xsysace_l.h must
* be changed accordingly.
*
* <b>Reading or Writing CompactFlash</b>
*
* The smallest unit that can be read from or written to CompactFlash is one
* sector. A sector is 512 bytes.  The functions provided by this driver allow
* the user to specify a starting sector ID and the number of sectors to be read
* or written. At most 256 sectors can be read or written in one operation. The
* user must ensure that the buffer passed to the functions is big enough to
* hold (512 * NumSectors), where NumSectors is the number of sectors specified.
*
* <b>Interrupt Mode</b>
*
* By default, the device and driver are in polled mode. The user is required to
* enable interrupts using XSysAce_EnableInterrupt(). In order to use interrupts,
* it is necessary for the user to connect the driver's interrupt handler,
* XSysAce_InterruptHandler(), to the interrupt system of the application. This
* function does not save and restore the processor context. An event handler
* must also be set by the user, using XSysAce_SetEventHandler(), for the driver
* such that the handler is called when interrupt events occur. The handler is
* called from interrupt context and allows application-specific processing to
* be performed.
*
* In interrupt mode, the only available interrupt is data buffer ready, so
* the size of a data transfer between interrupts is 32 bytes (the size of the
* data buffer).
*
* <b>Polled Mode</b>
*
* The sector read and write functions are blocking when in polled mode. This
* choice was made over non-blocking since sector transfer rates are high
* (>20Mbps) and the user can limit the number of sectors transferred in a single
* operation to 1 when in polled mode, plus the API for non-blocking polled
* functions was a bit awkward. Below is some more information on the sector
* transfer rates given the current state of technology (year 2002). Although
* the seek times for CompactFlash cards is high, this average hit needs to be
* taken every time a new read/write operation is invoked by the user. So the
* additional few microseconds to transfer an entire sector along with seeking
* is miniscule.
*
* - Microdrives are slower than CompactFlash cards by a significant factor,
*   especially if the MD is asleep.
*     - Microdrive:
*           - Power-up/wake-up time is approx. 150 to 1000 ms.
*           - Average seek time is approx. 15 to 20 ms.
*     - CompactFlash:
*           - Power-up/reset time is approx. 50 to 400 ms and wake-up time is
*             approx. 3 ms.
*           - "Seek time" here means how long it takes the internal controller
*             to process the command until the sector data is ready for transfer
*             by the ACE controller.  This time is approx. 2 ms per sector.
*
*  - Once the sector data is ready in the CF device buffer (i.e., "seek time" is
*    over) the ACE controller can read 2 bytes from the MD/CF device every 11
*    clock cycles, assuming no wait cycles happen.  For instance, if the clock
*    is 33 MHz, then then the max. rate that the ACE controller can transfer is
*    6 MB/sec.  However, due to other overhead (e.g., time for data buffer
*    transfers over MPU port, etc.), a better estimate is 3-5 MB/sec.
*
* <b>Mutual Exclusion</b>
*
* This driver is not thread-safe. The System ACE device has a single data
* buffer and therefore only one operation can be active at a time. The device
* driver does not prevent the user from starting an operation while a previous
* operation is still in progress. It is up to the user to provide this mutual
* exclusion.
*
* <b>Errors</b>
*
* Error causes are defined in xsysace_l.h using the prefix XSA_ER_*. The
* user can use XSysAce_GetErrors() to retrieve all outstanding errors.
*
* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00a rpm  06/17/02 work in progress
* 1.01a jvb  12/14/05 I separated dependency on the static config table and
*                     xparameters.h from the driver initialization by moving
*                     _Initialize and _LookupConfig to _sinit.c. I also added
*                     the new _CfgInitialize routine. (The dependency on
*                     XPAR_XSYSACE_MEM_WIDTH still remains.)
