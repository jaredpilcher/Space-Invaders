\section{Game Details and Specifications}

\subsection{Aliens}

\subsubsection{Alien Placement and Appearance}
There are 55 enemies that start on the screen.  They are on a 11 by 5 grid.  Each grid is 15 pixels by 15 pixels.  There are three types of aliens.  The first two rows are the widest aliens, the next two rows are a little narrower and the top row has the narrowest alien.

\subsubsection{Alien Movement}
The aliens move laterally in increments of 2 pixels.  When the rightmost aliens reach the right edge of the screen, the grid of aliens will move down 7 pixels and start moving left.  When the leftmost aliens reach the left edge of the screen, they will move down 7 pixels and start moving right.  The rightmost alien and leftmost alien is the closest alien to the respective sides that has not been killed. When the rightmost column of aliens are destroyed, the aliens march toward the side of the screen until the next column hits that side. The Aliens continue this pattern of movement untill the bottommost row reaches the bottom of the bunkers. 

\subsection{Alien Mothership}
The alien mothership flies across the screen from left to right. It's tiem of appearance is random. When a bullet strikes the mothership, it flashes, revealing the score received.

\subsection{The Tank}
The tank moves laterally across the bottom of the screen. The user is able to push the right button to move right, or push the left button to move left at a rate of two pixels. The user is able to hold down the left or right buttons to keep the tank moving accross the screen.

You may also fire a missile by pushing the middle button. The tank is capable of moving and firing simultaneously. It is also capable of changing direction while shooting. This means that it you are able to hold down the fire button and change directins.

\subsection{Bullets}
\subsubsection{Tank Bullets}
Tanks are capable of firing bullets by pushing the middle button. Tank bullets, unlike Alien Bullets, only have one appearance. They are white rectangles that are ejected just above the center of the tank. No black boxes surround the bullet. In other words, when it leaves the tank, or strikes an object, an overlay of a black box cannot be seen. When a bullet is on the screen, the tank cannot fire again until the bullet has left the screen. Each bullet travels at a distance of 2 pixels at a time. When it strikes an alien or mothership, the object is destroyed.

\subsubsection{Alien Bullets}
There are two types of alien bullets:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}  Zig zag bullets rotate cyclicly through the following appearances:

\begin{enumerate}
\item 

\item 

\item >
\item 2
\end{enumerate}

\item{}  Cross bullets oscillate through the following appearance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item T
\item +
\item L
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

Each bullet is ejected from the center of an alien, randomly chosen to be an alien on the bottommost row. There can only be 4 bullets on the screen at any given point in time.  Once a bullet leaves the screen, a new bullet can be fired. Each bullet travels at a distance of 2 pixels at a time. When the bullet strikes a tank, it is destroyed. When the bullet strikes a bunker, the bunker is eroded. When a piece of the bunker is completely eroded, the bullet can pass through it.  No black boxes surround the bullet. In other words, when it leaves an alien, or strikes an object, an overlay of a black box cannot be seen. 

\subsection{Scoring}
\includegraphics[]{scoring.jpg}

The game ends when one of the three events occur:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{} The bottommost row of aliens that are alive reach the bottom of the bunkers.
\item{} The tank has been destroyed three times.
\item{} All aliens are destroyed.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Appearance}
The game appearance is identical to the flash version of Space Invasion. The game runs smoothly and at a decent speed. The screen is also updated close to the same rate as the flash-based game. No artifacts appear on the screen. No flickering occurs on the screen.
